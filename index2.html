      PM Shehbaz Launches 10 Million Digital Wallets for BISP Beneficiaries
    </h1>

      Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Monday launched 10 million digital
      wallets for beneficiaries of the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP),
      calling it a <b>“historic milestone”</b> in Pakistan’s drive toward transparency,
      financial inclusion, and a cashless economy.

      The premier inaugurated the initiative through a symbolic palm-touch ceremony in Islamabad, attended by federal ministers, BISP leadership, and international development partners, including GIZ. He congratulated BISP Chairperson Senator Rubina Khalid and partner institutions, terming the move a <b>“landmark decision”</b> that will protect genuine recipients and ensure safe, transparent disbursement of assistance

      This digital wallet system is blessed by the soul of Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto, as it empowers beneficiaries with direct access to financial aid, Shehbaz said. He urged the programme’s leadership to link assistance with education and health compliance, stressing that “if a family receives support, it should ensure all children are in school and basic healthcare is observed.” He also directed that the current 8–10 month implementation cycle be reduced to four months.

      Separately, the prime minister chaired a meeting on the upcoming National Industrial Policy, underscoring the government’s priority to boost exports by strengthening domestic industries. “Our top priority is to develop an export-oriented economy by equipping industries with modern technology and world-class manpower,” he said, directing officials to consult all stakeholders in policy formulation.

      Later in the day, Shehbaz met three shepherds from Gilgit-Baltistan’s Ghizer district who saved around 300 lives during the recent floods by warning villagers ahead of the disaster. The premier awarded Sher Wali, Shakir Hussain, and Farmanullah Rs. 2.5 million each in recognition of their bravery.

      “These shepherds did what no technology or machinery could do at that critical moment; they saved lives by putting their own at risk,” said PML-N GB President Hafiz Hafeezur Rehman, who accompanied them.

      The Gilgit-Baltistan government also praised the recognition. Spokesperson Faizullah Faraq said Chief Minister Haji Gulbar Khan had already directed provincial awards, adding that other rescuers, including Hunza’s Karimullah Baig and Nasir from Chitorkhand Dain, would be honoured in a special ceremony at the CM Secretariat.
